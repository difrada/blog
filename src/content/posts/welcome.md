## Why This Blog?

We created this blog to document and share what we build, explore, and question as engineers working at the intersection of software, data, and emerging technologies.

We are three electronic engineers — [Juan Sebastián Rada](/authors/juan-sebastian-rada/), [Francisco Diago](/authors/francisco-diago/), and [Sebastián Franco](/authors/sebastian-franco/) — who met at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. Although our academic background is in electronics, our professional paths evolved toward software development, data engineering, cloud systems, and intelligent solutions.

This blog reflects that evolution.

## What Drives Us

Each of us brings a different technical focus:

- Francisco (“Pacho”) is deeply interested in infrastructure, cloud architecture, DevOps, and scalable systems.
- Juan Sebastián focuses on IoT, embedded systems, and hardware–software integration.
- I focus primarily on Artificial Intelligence, data systems, and applied machine learning.

Together, we explore how these domains converge to build innovative solutions.

## What You’ll Find Here

We will write about:

- Artificial Intelligence and applied machine learning  
- Data engineering and analytics architectures  
- Cloud infrastructure and distributed systems  
- IoT and hardware-driven projects  
- DevOps and MLOps  
- Rapid prototyping and experimental builds  
- Innovation-driven engineering solutions  

We are not trying to be the ultimate authority on any topic. Instead, we aim to document real projects, technical decisions, experiments, and lessons learned while building meaningful systems.

## How It Works

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), posts are written in Markdown, and everything lives in a GitHub repository. If you’d like to contribute, feel free to open a Pull Request.

Welcome to our journey.

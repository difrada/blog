## Are We Going to Use AI… or Build It?

The question is uncomfortable but necessary.

Are we going to settle for *using* AI — or are we going to truly learn how to build it?

A close friend once told me a phrase that stayed with me:  
> “Europe has become the world’s museum.”

Not as an insult, but as a warning. A continent with extraordinary history, culture, and quality of life — yet struggling to lead the technologies that now define economic and productive power.

That idea resurfaced after recent discussions around Europe’s AI strategy.

## The Investment Gap

According to the Stanford AI Index (2025), private AI investment between 2013 and 2024 tells a very clear story:

- The United States leads by a massive margin.
- China follows, significantly behind but still dominant.
- The United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and others trail far behind.
- Many countries are barely visible.
- Some, effectively, are not even in the game.

(See chart below.)

While the European Union has committed tens of billions of euros to AI through programs like Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, EuroHPC, and the new AI Factories, the challenge is not only funding. It is fragmentation, speed, coordination, and the ability to translate investment into scalable technological leadership.

AI leadership is not declared — it is built through infrastructure.

## And What About Colombia?

If Europe is concerned about strategic autonomy, Colombia — and Latin America in general — are several steps further behind.

This is not criticism. It is diagnosis.

Colombia has:
- A National AI Policy (CONPES 4144)
- Strong universities
- Competitive technical talent
- Real AI use cases in banking, fraud detection, analytics, marketing, and public services

But our relationship with AI is still primarily about **consumption**, not **construction**.

In practice, doing AI in Colombia often means:
- Using models trained abroad  
- Running workloads on foreign cloud infrastructure  
- Paying for compute we do not control  
- Depending on architectural decisions made elsewhere  

That may be acceptable in early stages. It does not build strategic capacity.

## AI Is Not Just Models

AI is not just prompts.

It is:
- Compute clusters  
- Energy capacity  
- GPUs and hardware supply chains  
- Distributed systems engineering  
- Inference optimization  
- Low-level software  
- Data infrastructure at scale  

The biggest gap in many developing economies is not creativity or ambition. It is infrastructure and deep technical capacity.

And there is a structural issue we rarely address honestly:  
**brain drain.**

The engineers who work on hardware, compilers, inference engines, distributed training systems, and high-performance infrastructure often leave. Many do not return.

We retain professionals who know how to *use* AI.  
We lose those who know how to *build* it.

## Changing the Conversation

More AI courses are not enough.  
More hackathons are not enough.  
More prompt engineering workshops are not enough.

What we need is:

- Investment in local compute clusters  
- Public–private partnerships around infrastructure  
- Companies building AI systems from within the region  
- Programs that send deep technical talent abroad — and bring them back  
- A strategy where foreign clouds are a complement, not the entire foundation  

AI is not just software.

It is energy policy.  
It is industrial strategy.  
It is long-term national vision.

## The Real Question

The chart is not just about money.  
It is about direction.

Are we comfortable being permanent users of AI?

Or are we willing to invest — technically, economically, and strategically — in building it?

The difference will define the next decades.

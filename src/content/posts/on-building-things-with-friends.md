## It starts with a conversation

Most of the best things I've been part of started the same way: someone said "what if we..." and instead of moving on, we actually tried it. This blog is one of those things.

## Why bother?

We all have day jobs. We're not short on things to do. But there's something different about building something that's yours — not a ticket on a board, not someone else's roadmap. Something you chose to make because you wanted it to exist.

## The real value

The blog itself is nice. But the real value is in the process: the late-night debugging sessions, the design arguments, the pull request reviews where someone catches a typo you've read past fifteen times. It's the building together that matters.

Writing forces you to think clearly. Publishing forces you to care about clarity. And doing it with friends means you'll actually finish it.
